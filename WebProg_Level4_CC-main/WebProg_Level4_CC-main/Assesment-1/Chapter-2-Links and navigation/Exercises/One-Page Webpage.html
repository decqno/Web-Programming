          The story takes place up North on the Island of Berk, where Hiccup, the son of the Clan's Chief, 
          desired to join his father in fighting against the dragons that continually raid their town. Unfortunate for him, 
          his father, Stoik the Vast, refused to let his skinny and clumsy son take part in a fight against such dangerous
          species. This, however, did not stop Hiccup from venturing out into battle to prove to his father that he is worthy.
          With such determination, Hiccup downs a Night Fury, the rarest and unseen dragon there is. He was ready to kill it with
          a blade so sharp, yet he hesitates as he saw that the dragon, known for its cruelity, was just as scared as he was.
          And so, in that moment, is where an unexpected friendship between supposed enemies started. Now the only problem
          the two have to face is to convince the people that they've misunderstood the creatures.

			<p>The following are the people who left a review of the 2010 animation film:</p>

			  <p><dd><q>I don’t usually leave a review , but I don’t think many people talk about how amazing the world
			  (of How To Train Your Dragon )Dreamworks created is. I fell in love with the movie when I was 7, and I used to crush 
			  on Hiccup and Tuffnut HARD. ( I still sometimes do crush on tuffnut )  Toothless was my favorite thing to draw, I 
			  remember drawing him over and over again. I remember drawing the other new dragons everyday with my dad. Now after a 
			  long time, I realized that it still is an amazing movie even as a now adult. I rewatched all the movies again, and 
			  still enjoyed it a lot. The world is vast and so much to explore, dragon types, groups of people that could be bad or 
			  good, dragon hunters and people who keep them as pets. It’s such a fun world to explore and be in, there is even many 
			  places to travel to without the hidden world. But I still really enjoyed the idea of a hidden world made to life in the 
			  3rd movie. Who knows how many more magical places could there be in this huge world? I still love thinking about it. It’s 
			  such a cool world to explore, there is so much to imagine further. It was my favorite Dreamworks movie, and honestly 
			  still is. As this was one of my my favorite childhood movies aside, I might be a little biased with the five stars. 
			  Still though, great movie.</q></dd></p>

			  <p><dd><q>I have nothing but praises for these films. I recently just finished the 3rd installment of the 
			  trilogy and my god is my eyes puffy. It's such a beautiful, fun, heartwarming watch with the greatest of animation presented 
			  in each newer release. Maybe it's because I'm such an animal lover with a soft heart and the biggest empathy for relationships 
			  that I just can't help but fall in love with, not just the world they built but also, the connection each character has with 
			  each other-- they wrote it so beautifully! And the lessons they give speaks to you because it's relevant and executed so well. 
			  Don't even get me started on that beautiful score that never fails to make me tear up as I reminisce on the amazing scenes 
			  they played it on. This officially replaces Shrek as my favourite trilogy/franchise. Worth the watch, will be showing 
			  it to my future kids.</q></dd></p>

			<p><dt><b>William Werlein: 5/5 Stars</b></dt></p>
			  <p><dd><q>The BEST FILM OF ALL TIME! Coming out when I was only 3, this has been a staple 
			  in my childhood. It almost brings me to tears by just thinking about it. It appealed to me when I was younger because 
			  it is fun and action packed. But now being 16 I can really appreciate this film for what it is. A MASTERPIECE. The 
			  music, animation, voice acting, story, and the characters is what makes this my favorite movie ever. Man! When any 
			  of these songs play they pull so much emotion, and elevate the scene to another level. The overall story is amazing! 
			  Seeing the characters develop never gets old. The picture of Hiccup putting his hand out for Toothless to accept 
			  him is ingrained into my soul. I love this movie sooooo much. 11/10</q></dd></p>
